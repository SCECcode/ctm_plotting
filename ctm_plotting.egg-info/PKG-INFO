# Installation: 
Prerequisite :  anaconda with python3 virtual environment. The python3 environment should include the 
following libraries. It is highly recommended to create an environment with this command to bring in 
the required python XXX modules
 
* conda create -n python3 python>3.0 scipy pip numpy matplotlib

* git clone https://github.com/SCECcode/ctm_plotting.git
* cd into ctm_plotting
* ./unpack-dist
* This will build the ctm_plotting utilities, and add the ctm_plotting scripts to the users path.

* If needs to repackage the ctm_plotting (./make-dist), need addictional python pkg  
*    conda install setuptools wheel

# Usage:
Once ctm_plotting is installed, users can run ctm_plotting scripts like this:

### plot_depth_profile.py

The following command will produce a depth profile of CVM-H v15.1 for Vs, Vp and density at (34,-118) from depth of 0 to 50000m
<pre>
./plot_depth_profile.py -s 34,-118 -b 0 -e 50000 -d vs,vp,density -v 500 -c cvmh -o depth_profile.png
</pre>

### plot_horizontal.py
The following command will produce a horizontal map view plot plot of Vs values from CVM-H v15.1 at a depth of 500m for the Los Angeles region.
<pre>
./plot_horizontal_slice.py -b 33.5,-118.75 -u 34.5,-117.5 -s 0.01 -e 500 -d vs -a s -c cvmh
</pre>
